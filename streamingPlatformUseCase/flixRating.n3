# In the short term; this is something that the streaming platform would have to declare; but
# in the long term even this kind of condition would probably belong to a 3rd party censoring
# authority.

# Also note that down the line this would also be *user specific*

# Further note that this does not prevent the company from caching the remote rules and ratings.

# Look into rule descriptions. It might be useful for displaying "error" messages to the user like.
# "You are not old enough to watch this movie".
