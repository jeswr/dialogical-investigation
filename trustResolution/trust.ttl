# For this demo we are using rot:trusts to mean blindly trusting *everything* that is stated. From there we can
# make notions of trust more complex, but this is a good starting point.

# In time it is going to be important to heavily distinguish between things like direct trust and endorsments.
# For instance, I might trust someone because I have an SLA with them; but I wouldn't endorse them to you unless
# you have an SLA with them as well. This is when concepts like X trusts Y for A become important.

# Soon I think we will need to introduce concepts of "understands" for vocabs and "implements" for specifications
# like verifiable credentials in order to enable dynamic communication.
